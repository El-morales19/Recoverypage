# Password Recovery - 2FA Example

## Description
This project simulates a password recovery page with two-factor authentication (2FA) for academic purposes. The structure and design of the page are intended to provide a practical example in the context of two-step verification as part of a school project.

## Purpose
This example is part of a project to be presented in an academic context, specifically at ENALLT. It is **not** intended for commercial use or for production implementations.

## Usage
- **This project should be used exclusively for educational purposes.**
- It is not recommended to use this code in production applications, as it does not implement real security and is only designed for demonstration purposes.

## Project Description
The page allows users to enter their email address to receive a verification code, simulating the password recovery process on a platform with 2FA. This simulation is part of a larger example on the adoption of two-factor authentication among youth.
